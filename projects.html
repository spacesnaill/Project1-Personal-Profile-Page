        <p>
          In this project I used Ruby on Rails to create an event planning website. In this website, users create a website and are then able to create events for other users to view and RSVP for. When the user creates an event, it asks for basic information
          such as where and when, along with a name for the event and some details behind what the event is. After the user is finished, the event is posted to the website where other users can see and click an RSVP button along with comment on the event. The
          user that created the event can then edit the event after the fact if they find an mistake or delete the event.

        <h2>Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) Checker</h2>
        <img src="images/Java_Logo.svg" alt="Logo for the Java programming language" class="code-logo"/>
        <p>
          In this project, the assignment was to take a file as an inpute (specified by the user) and turn its specific formatting into a DFA. The user then specified another file with Strings to run through the DFA, along with an output file to send the
          results to. This project is done entirely in Java and does exactly what the specifications require of it. It takes the input file and assembles a DFA using a graph structure before running each String through, piece by piece, to see if the input is
          valid. If the program gets to the end of the String and it is at a Final state, then the String is valid but if it gets to the end of the String and it is not at a final state then the String is invalid. To help visualization, each state is a node in
          the graph whilst each letter is a sort of "weight" for the edges connecting the nodes.
