        <h2>Graduate Assistant</h2>
        <p>
          Alongside my graduate classes, I help a couple of professors with their undergrad classes. I oversee lab classes of
  undergrad students, assisting them with the material and grading their projects.

        <h2>Grant Work</h2>
        <p>Working on a grant for Telemedicine in which patients can talk to family and friends via an app or through a kiosk at the hospital. A couple of major tools for this was C# and asp.net but I mostly worked on the Front End with another student.</p>

        <h2>Research Assistant</h2>
        <p>Worked to migrate a visual forensics program from C to Java. The program itself is meant to detect alterations in
  an image, such as cropping an existing part of the image over something else to hide it or adding something to the
  image.</p>
